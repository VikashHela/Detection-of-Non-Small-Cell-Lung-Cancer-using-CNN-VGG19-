## Introduction
Non small cell lung cancer NSCLC is one of the major type of lung cancer in the world. The treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are based mainly on the stage (extent) of the cancer because if detected at early stage then it can be properly diagnosed in time. This paper discusses the detection of non small cell lung cancer using the techniques of Convolution Neural Network. The system takes CT scan images which incorporates a tremendous amount of information about nodules. The primary aim of the project is to design a deep learning algorithm that will efficiently extract features from CT scan images and classify them to provide precise and timely diagnosis of lung cancer. The project consist of two phases feature extraction and classification for which we have used VGG19 architecture. It is variant of VGG, a deep Convolution Neural Network which consists of 19 layers(16 - convolution layers, 3 - Fully connected layer, 5 - MaxPool layers and 1 - SoftMax layer). Examining the vast amount of CT images can reduce the risk. Recently, various methods are evolved based on handcraft and learned approach to assist radiologists.
